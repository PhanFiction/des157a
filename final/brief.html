        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
          For the project, I plan to introduce more interactivity into the game such as animation. I plan to add a functionality
          where the players can choose the number of score they want. I also plan on adding a background into the game to make it more
          lively. For the players, I plan to add a picture for each player to make it look more like a profile from video games. I am also
          planning on allowing the user to choose their own name. For functionality, the game could be better optimized by using
          object oriented.

        <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          I plan to have the TA or the professor give me feedback on my design. This would be professors like Lloyd Wheeler or
          the class TA because they have more experience in this field. For the specialized feedback on functionality, I can have a friend
          who is a software engineer look over my code.
