      <h1>Visual Design improvement for Game On Final</h1>
      <img class="img" src="image/Group1.png" alt="img">
      <p>
        For my visual design, I am trying to improve the button layout where it is not circulur but instead rectangular. I am also
        trying to add animation to it when the user hovers over the button, it changes color. For the background, I decided to add 
        an image to it to make the game look more lively instead of making it focused with only a single color. I also added 
        the feature to allow users to input their name and the max score they wanted to get up to.

      <h1>10 Intriguing Photographs Visual Thinking</h1>
      <p>
        I found the The images are intriguing because they intentionally provoke a sense of curiosity and confusion, prompting students to delve deeper into the details. The text suggests that the initial "huh?" reaction sparks enough interest to make students want to explore and analyze the images more thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The text doesn't provide specific details about individual images, but it implies that each image has a backstory or context that can be revealed by clicking on a link associated with the image. This adds an extra layer of information that may not be immediately apparent from a cursory glance at the image alone
      </p>
      <p>
        The archive or collection, in this case, focuses on visual stimuli that facilitate close reading and visual thinking skills. The images are carefully selected to be thought-provoking, aligning with the overarching goal of enhancing students' ability to observe and interpret visual content.
      </p>

        The collection reveals the author's commitment to innovative teaching methods that extend beyond traditional text-based learning. It reflects a dedication to nurturing critical thinking, curiosity, and literacy skills in students by incorporating engaging visual elements into the learning process. The author's emphasis on using these images as conversation starters suggests a desire to foster interactive and dynamic learning environments.

      <h1>Game Design Research (Learning Journal)</h1>
      <p>
        Amir Dori's insights into game design, backed by over a decade of experience and data from millions of users, provide a valuable perspective on optimizing user experience and engagement in mobile games. His emphasis on data-driven decision-making and the practical application of these insights in real-world scenarios is commendable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I appreciate the practical tips shared, such as the strategic placement of interactive elements for monetization in the comfort-to-reach areas and the considerations for sliders, pop-ups, and draggable objects. The attention to detail, like setting custom anchor-point offsets for draggable items and using glow or dashed outlines for drop-zone areas, reflects a thorough understanding of user interaction nuances.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recommendations for rewarded videos, rate us dialogs, and store dialogs showcase a thoughtful approach to balancing user satisfaction and revenue generation. The emphasis on timing the 'rate us' dialog after significant achievements or accumulations of small satisfaction points aligns with fostering a positive user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amir's acknowledgment that these are best practices rather than strict rules emphasizes the need for adaptability and creativity in game design. It's evident that his insights are rooted in practical application, making them more relatable and actionable for other game designers and developers.

        Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows
      </h2>
      <p>
        The best practices for modals, overlays, and dialog windows revolve around creating user-friendly experiences and maintaining consistency in design and functionality. These practices emphasize the importance of clear communication, ensuring that modals are purposeful, concise, and easily dismissible. Consistency in design language, responsiveness across devices, accessibility for all users, and efficient performance are essential. Avoiding overuse, utilizing proper visual hierarchy, and conducting usability testing to gather feedback and improve user experience are also crucial components. Contextual cues to direct user attention and implementing these practices collectively enhance the usability and effectiveness of modals within applications or websites.

      <h2>Best practices for form design</h2>
      <p>
        After reading that article, I realized how imporant it is when
        When creating web forms, it's crucial to implement best practices to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience. 
        Progress indicators are invaluable in multi-step forms, providing users with a clear understanding of their position 
        in the process and reducing anxiety. Placeholder text within input fields offers users additional context, although 
        it's essential not to rely solely on placeholders for crucial information, as they may vanish when users start typing. 
        Auto-formatting and validation, such as formatting phone numbers or offering real-time feedback for invalid email addresses, 
        prevent errors and enhance data accuracy. Effective error handling, with clear error messages and distinctive field highlighting,
        helps users correct mistakes. Mobile responsiveness is a must, ensuring that forms adapt to different devices. 
        Accessibility is key, allowing all users to navigate and complete forms, regardless of disabilities. 
        A well-labeled 'Submit' or 'Next' button reduces confusion, and confirmation screens instill a sense of completion. 
        User-friendly CAPTCHA and transparent privacy and security information contribute to a trustworthy user experience, 
        enhancing overall form usability.
